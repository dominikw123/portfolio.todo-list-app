# __Todo List App__
A clean and minimal todo list application that provides full task management functionality, including creating, editing, deleting, and completing tasks.
The project is structured with modular components and reusable hooks, focuses on maintainability, and delivers a smooth and responsive user experience across all screen sizes.
The application persists tasks along with their state and user preferences, such as the selected theme, all stored in local storage to ensure data is preserved between sessions.
